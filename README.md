## Description 

Repository containing code and ParaView statefiles to execute and visualize output from the Rossby Wave Identification algorithm as detailed in the paper 

An Integrated Geometric and Topological Approach for the Identification and Visual Analysis of Rossby Wave Packets.
Karran Pandey, Joy Merwin Monteiro, and Vijay Natarajan.
2020, to appear. 

While fully funcitonal code for our algorithm is present in the repository, we are currently still in the process of developing a user friendly API package for convenient use of our algorithm. Hence, please contact us if you wish to use the code in its current form.
